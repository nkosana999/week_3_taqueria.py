# Felipe’s Taqueria
This a program that enables a user to place an order, prompting them for items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d (which is a common way of ending one’s input to a program). After each inputted item, display the total cost of all items inputted thus far, prefixed with a dollar sign ($) and formatted to two decimal places. Treat the user’s input case insensitively. Ignore any input that isn’t an item. Assume that every item on the menu will be titlecased.

## My notes:
I had only one challange with this task, my program runs well as expected per instruction. However upon runing it through the check50, I on recieving a notification of a bug in my proble. I do not really understand this error message and therefore have no clue as to how to fix it. 

## Error message:
"expected exit code 0, not 1"
